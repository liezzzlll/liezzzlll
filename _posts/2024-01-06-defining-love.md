Had an epiphany that **the act of love is to foster growth**.  I saw this message on a barista's t-shirt. Got me shooketh fam. I was just trying to get work done, not have an existential crisis at the coffee shop...  

I'm grateful for seeing the message though. hehehehe, here's a reflection I had when I got home:

Recently, a powerful realization struck me: <i>experiencing love is fundamentally about fostering growth</i>, be it in others or within ourselves. This perspective has illuminated the myriad forms of **love** if my life - from nurturing my plants and ensuring their flourishing, to the emotional and mental growth shared with friends and family, to the joy and care in looking after my pets, and the passion I pour in my hobbies. It's a reminder that growth transcends mere physical change, encompassing inner peace and well-being, especially for the beings under my care. 

This insight has gained poignancy as I reflect on the people who have chosen different paths in life, paths that diverge from mine. It's a reminder that the people we love are reflections of ourselves. They act as **mirrors**, showcasing the values and beliefs we hold dear. Those who walk away from our lives have grown with us for a time, even if their paths eventually lead them elsewhere. Sometimes we find ourselves among those who don't treat us well, mirroring the times we aren't kind to ourselves. But if we're fortunate, & I hope we all are, we'll find love that mirrors the level of self love we possess, whether it's platonic or romantic. The people we love and continue to cherish are reflections of who we are, and those who chose different paths of growth aren't reflecting **on** us, but rather on <i>their own visions for their lives</i>. 

& that's the essence of life: **the <i>autonomy</i> to choose our path of growth.** I hope each of you find a path that aligns with your core values and your vision of a fulfilling life.  I hope you surround yourself with people who reflect what you believe in, what you're passionate about, and what matters deeply most to you. I hope we all choose a path of peace, kindness to yourself & to others. 

Lots of love + light.
