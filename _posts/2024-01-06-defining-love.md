Had an epiphany that **the act of love is to foster growth**.  I saw this message on a barista's t-shirt. Got me shooketh fam. I was just trying to get work done, not have an existential crisis at the coffee shop...  

I'm grateful for seeing the message though. hehehehe, here's a reflection I had when I got home:

Recently, a powerful realization truck me: <i>experiencing love is fundamentally about fostering growth</i>, be it in others or within ourselves. This perspective has illuminated the myriad forms of **love** if my life - from nurturing my plants and ensuring their flourishing, to the motional and mental growth shared with friends, to the joy and care in looking after my pets, and the engagement in my hobbies. It's a reminder that growth transcends mere physical change, encompassing inner peace and well-being, especially for the beings under my care. 

The people who come into our lives, whether they stay or leave, are not just companions or memories; they are **mirrors**, reflecting parts of ourselves we need to examine, understand, and nurture. 

Lots of love + light.
