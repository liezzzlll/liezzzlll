Guess what? I just had my mind blown at Mammoth Cave, and OMG, it was like stepping into a video game, but like, for real. You know how in Dark Souls everything is all mysterious and you're always turning corners into something epic? That was me, in a massive cave, minus the monsters (thankfully!).

So, I'm walking through these massive chambers, right? And it's all cool and dim, with these wild rock formations that look like they're straight out of a fantasy game. I swear, it felt like I was about to bump into a boss around every bend. But instead of finding a knight or a dragon, it was all about these stunning stalactites and fossils. Nature's own version of loot, if you ask me.

And gworlllll, the stories! This place has _seen_ some stuff. And then, there's this part of the story that's a bit of a downer. Ran into the tale of George Morrison and the whole "cave wars" saga. It's like, Morrison had big dreams for Mammoth Cave, right? But it kinda turned into this greed-fest, all about drawing in the crowds, without much thought for the cave's well-being or its future. Made me think of those side quests in games that seem cool at first but then you realize the quest giver is all about their own gain. Except, this wasn't a game. It was real life, and the cave was what paid the price.

It got me feeling all kinds of sad, wondering what if. What if folks who genuinely cared about Mammoth Cave had been the ones to shape its story? Imagine a version of history where Mammoth Cave was nurtured by ethical tourism from the start, where preserving its magic and mystery was the main quest. It's like stumbling into a hidden, peaceful village in Dark Souls that's somehow survived untouched, where everyone's working together to keep it safe from the outside world's madness.

Thinking about that made the whole adventure bittersweet. It's a reminder that our real-world "levels" need guardians who play the long game, protecting and preserving them so future adventurers can experience their wonders too, not just exploit them for a quick win.

It's wild to think about how games mimic these natural wonders and epic histories. Walking through the cave, with its secret passages and ancient mysteries, I totally got why game devs are into creating these fantasy landscapes. It's like they've been to places like Mammoth Cave and thought, "Yep, this is it. This is the vibe we're going for."

Alright, Journal, I gotta wrap this up. Today was a reminder that sometimes, you don't need a controller to find yourself in the middle of an epic adventure. Nature's got all the cool settings and boss fights we could ever want. Well, minus the actual fighting, which is fine by me!

p.s. look at where my friend and I glamped! s'cute ^_^
