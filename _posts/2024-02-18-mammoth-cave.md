Guess what, Journal? Today, I plunged ~300ft into the depths of Mammoth Cave, Kentucky. It felt like I had stepped right into a video game—Dark Souls, to be exact. Navigating through the tight chambers that suddenly open into vast caverns was nothing short of surreal. The stalactites and stalagmites, with their otherworldly forms, seemed as if they were plucked straight from a fantasy realm.

Yet, as I marveled at these subterranean wonders, a shadow of a darker history loomed over the awe. The era known as the "cave wars" painted a picture of fierce rivalry and competition, where the sanctity of the cave was often sacrificed on the altar of tourism and greed. More haunting were the tales of slave laborers, coerced into the very backbone of the cave's exploration and development, their monumental efforts eclipsed by the cruel reality of their exploitation. This somber chapter of Mammoth Cave not only serves as a grim reminder of the lengths to which greed can blind us but also beckons us to honor those unsung heroes who have shaped our natural heritage.

This revelation stirred a whirlpool of emotions within me. What if Mammoth Cave had been shepherded by souls who truly cherished its magnificence? I envisioned an alternate history where ethical stewardship prevailed, where the cave's enigmatic beauty and legacy were the paramount quests. It conjured images of a Dark Souls village, untouched and serene, safeguarded by a community united against the encroaching darkness.
Thinking about that made the whole adventure bittersweet. It's a reminder that our real-world "levels" need guardians who play the long game, protecting and preserving them so future adventurers can experience their wonders too, not just exploit them for a quick win.

Reflecting on this duality infused my adventure with a bittersweet essence. It underscored the need for guardians in our "real-world levels"—vigilant protectors committed to preserving these wonders for the adventurers of tomorrow, not as mere stops along a tour, but as sanctuaries to be revered and conserved.

Amidst the echoes of the cave, I found a deeper understanding of why game developers draw inspiration from such places. Mammoth Cave, with its labyrinthine passageways and silent histories, embodies the essence of the fantasy landscapes we cherish in games. It's as if they, too, have ventured into caves like this and thought, "This is the magic we wish to capture."

So, here's where I sign off, Journal. Today reminded me that adventure doesn't always require a controller. The earth itself is replete with settings and narratives richer than any game could offer—minus the boss fights, of course, and I'm totally okay with that.

p.s. look at where my friend and I glamped! s'cute ^_^
