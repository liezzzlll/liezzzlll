Woohoo!  I did it!  I'm excited to keep building this! My next steps are:
- make a soundcloud to drop original music content on this website
- add to the "videos" tab
- KEEP CREATING!!!! WOOOOHOOOOO!!

I started making this GitHub page at the beginning of Jan 2024, and just pushed the site live on this day!

kk til next update,
