### Introduction
In this commentary, I present my perspective as an inquisitive person profoundly influenced by the narratives that shape our society, especially after viewing the movie [Dune 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune:_Part_Two), a sci-fi book-turned-movie adaptation, during my ongoing exploration of the historical non-fiction book "[Sapiens](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2/)." I want to make it clear that I'm not an expert in history or science fiction. Instead, these insights come from my personal reactions to the significant societal themes in Dune Part 2, which resonated with me deeply.

Although I haven't read the Dune book series, my reading of "Sapiens" has enriched my understanding of the critical human experiences mirrored in the film. Set against a sci-fi backdrop, Dune's storyline reverberates with the three critical revolutions—**cognitive, agricultural, and scientific**—highlighted in "Sapiens," which have directed the course of human history. This personal essay reflects my attempt to articulate how a sci-fi story can mirror non-fictional historical themes, offering a lens through which we can examine our past, interrogate our present, and consider a future that, unsettlingly, doesn't feel entirely out of reach.

So as of **today, Saturday, March 9th, 2024…** I’ve read about 30% of the book, currently in the middle of the Agricultural Revolution section. To enhance my engagement with this book, I've decided to adopt a unique approach for my personal essay, let’s call it a "<i>fluid-essay</i>"! This evolving piece will progressively unfold as I navigate through "Sapiens," with each segment reflecting upon corresponding themes within the renowned sci-fi saga turned film, "Dune." So at this point, I will focus on the **Cognitive Revolution**, since I’ve finished that portion of the book, Sapiens. The idea is to capture my evolving reflections, allowing myself (and readers of this post) to witness the growth of my understanding and insights as I progress through the book. By the end, I aim to synthesize these reflections into a comprehensive summary analysis, offering a nuanced perspective on the intertwining narratives of human history and speculative fiction. 
<i>Thanks for joining me on this journey!</i>

### Cognitive Revolution
#### Sapiens (historical lens)
In Yuval Noah Harari's "Sapiens," we learn how the cognitive revolution, occurring between 70,000 to 30,000 years ago, transformed the way humans think and communicate. This pivotal shift allowed people to discuss abstract concepts, not just their immediate environment, fostering a newfound ability for large-scale cooperation essential for societal progress. [Gossip](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2214160121#:~:text=The%20deterrent%20power%20of%20gossipers,jointly%20sustains%20the%20evolutionary%20cycle.), as Harari intriguingly points out, played a crucial role in this evolution, enabling humans to become self-aware and understand the importance of social alliances. **The key to uniting vast numbers of individuals**, he suggests, **lies in the power of shared <i>myths</i> and <i>stories</i>.**

Harari elaborates that these **myths** underpin the foundations of our most complex structures: <i>religions, legal systems, and nations</i> are all built on [collective beliefs](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-24708-1_12), none of which hold tangible existence outside the human imagination. These shared narratives allow us to collaborate on unprecedented scales, constructing vast cities and mighty empires.

#### Dune (sci-fi lens)
"Dune" offers a compelling parallel to this concept through the enigmatic [Bene Gesserit](https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Bene_Gesserit) order, an entity that subtly shapes the universe's socio-political fabric under the guise of religious and moral guidance. Central to their agenda is the [Golden Path](https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Path), a grandiose scheme to direct human evolution and society towards a meticulously orchestrated future, utilizing a rigorous breeding program to create the Kwisatz Haderach, a being of unparalleled power.

Enter Paul Atreides, a key character in this elaborate plan, who embodies the Bene Gesserit's aspirations yet ultimately subverts their expectations. Raised on Arrakis amidst the prophecy-revering Fremen—prophecies the Bene Gesserit themselves manipulated via the Missionaria Protectiva—Paul's destiny unfurls in unexpected ways. His encounter with the potent spice melange awakens formidable abilities, aligning him with the Fremen's messianic visions.

However, Paul's arc deviates from the conventional hero's journey, highlighting the problematic nature of prophetic and messianic leadership. Though poised as a _liberator_, his ascent triggers a violent crusade across the stars, **contradicting the salvation narrative** and emphasizing the unintended consequences of his rise. Paul is not the infallible savior he's perceived to be but a **product of calculated schemes and broader socio-political machinations**, a poignant reminder of the perils embedded in uncritical hero worship and the intricate dance of fate and agency.

#### Present day (current lens)
You know, this part is not easy for me to articulate, and I feel a bit embarrassed to acknowledge my naivety regarding the current global landscape, largely shaped by my consumption of bite-sized content from platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels. Nonetheless, I am committed to approaching this topic with as much diligence and insight as I can muster. It seems undeniable that the **collective imaginations** shaping our modern society are _vivid_ and _forceful_. In America, for instance, potent ideologies like nationalism, religious fervor, and the adoration of wealth and power persistently sculpt our shared reality.

Today, echoes of the past resonate in the present, where exploitation and conflict continue unabated. Situations like the ongoing conflicts and humanitarian crises in places like [Gaza](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/05/1235940178/more-u-s-aid-air-dropped-into-gaza) and [Yemen](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/09/1237172295/yemens-rebels-target-singapore-flagged-ship-as-u-s-and-allies-down-houthi-drones) starkly illustrate how certain narratives and beliefs justify the exploitation and suffering of many for the comfort of others. These scenarios often hinge on collective beliefs—whether they be economic benefits, territorial rights, or religious convictions—that validate these tragic realities.

Our society collectively subscribes to various constructs, like the value of currency or the concept of national borders, which exist solely in our **[shared imaginations](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/untitled-7f6f4b06-fa8b-412a-8ebc-eafb105831d9/section/f4fb51a8-0f22-4ea5-8f8e-423b9892fce7#:~:text=Collective%20imagination%20is%20a%20set,Psychology%20Concepts%E2%80%9D%2C%202015)**. Similarly, our legal and moral frameworks, which dictate right from wrong, are testament to the enduring power of **collective beliefs**. These _imagined realities_, though _intangible_, **have** <u>tangible</u> consequences, influencing our actions and shaping the world we navigate daily.

#### Summary
In weaving together insights from Yuval Noah Harari's "Sapiens" and the sci-fi universe of "Dune," juxtaposed with our present-day realities, this exploration delves deep into the power of shared myths and collective imaginations across different epochs and civilizations. From the cognitive revolution that reshaped early human society by fostering complex communication and collaboration, to the intricate socio-political ploys within "Dune's" universe orchestrated by the Bene Gesserit, we observe a common thread: **the profound impact of _collective beliefs_ in shaping human destiny**.

"Sapiens" articulates how shared myths have underpinned the rise of vast empires and complex societal structures, binding large groups of people together under **common goals or beliefs**. Similarly, in "Dune," we witness how orchestrated beliefs and prophecies can steer the course of an entire galaxy, highlighting the power and perils of messianic and prophetic leadership.

Reflecting on our current era, we see these dynamics still at play, where collective narratives drive national, economic, and moral frameworks, often leading to profound and sometimes troubling outcomes. As we draw parallels between the distant past, speculative futures, and our own time, we recognize the enduring influence of shared myths — whether they propel us toward greatness or lead us astray.

In conclusion, this journey through different lenses — **historical, fictional, and contemporary** — underscores a timeless truth: **the stories we believe in collectively not only define our reality but also shape our future**. By examining these narratives critically, we can better navigate our world and perhaps steer it toward a more enlightened path.
