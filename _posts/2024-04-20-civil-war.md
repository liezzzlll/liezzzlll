**SPOILER ALERT:** I'll be spilling some stuffs about the A24 film, Civil War (2024)! Consider yourself warned!!!

## Opening Thoughts and Personal Impact
Holy shit, [Civil War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17279496/) was such a thought-provoking movie. It pulled me into a war-torn reality that many of us are desensitized to. Sitting in the theater, I felt uneasy witnessing the dystopian reality unfold in the opening scene. There was Lee, the main character, seemingly isolated in the comfort of her hotel room, while just outside her window, we saw civil unrest, burning buildings, and an eerily empty New York City. I found it uncanny, seeing how our reality mirrors the movie’s depiction of a dystopian US society. As we scroll through social media, our feeds fluctuate between glimpses of friends and celebrities flaunting luxury cars and opulent lifestyles, and the stark, [heart-wrenching photos and videos of the situation in Gaza](https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2024/04/06/1243045848/israel-gaza-hamas-6-months-war).

## Character Analysis and Development
The director, Alex Garland, deliberately avoids delving into the political science and traditional war strategies often depicted in war films. Instead, the focus is on the inner lives of the characters, such as Lee, who navigates her emotional turmoil amidst the unfolding complexities of war. Lee's encounters with trauma are poignantly illustrated in intense scenes where her PTSD symptoms surface—like when she's visibly shaken while shooting in the field. We also observe her colleague, Joel, making jokes with soldiers after a harrowing event, and Jesse, capturing the moment of Lee's death. These moments effectively highlight how each character copes with or disregards their deep-seated trauma.

## Imagery and Symbolism
The use of vivid, almost psychedelic imagery adds a unique layer to Lee's perceptions. Recall the scene where Lee tries on a dress and the mirror reflects a distorted, colorful image back at her, or the winter wonderland scene where she observes Jesse moving through the grass and wildflowers. These and similar scenes toward the film's end seem to symbolize the breaking down of the emotional walls Lee has constructed. These moments typically follow meaningful interactions with Jesse, whose youthful spirit and vulnerability remind Lee of her earlier self. **This imagery not only highlights the evolution of their relationship but also symbolizes Lee’s gradual reconnection with her lost emotions.**

## Societal Commentary
This movie acts almost like a mirror reflecting our own desensitization to global unrest and conflict. The unclear reasons behind the war and the arbitrary division of forces in the movie echo real-world conflicts, where often, the origins and sides are obscured by the chaos and suffering they cause. There’s a powerful message here: **in war, there are no true winners.** The film challenges us to confront our own apathy and perhaps, rekindle a sense of empathy that's been dulled by _constant_ exposure to distant tragedies.

## Personal Anecdotes from the Theater Experience
By the way, it was fascinating to see how people in the theater reacted at the end of the movie. While some walked out, clearly moved, one guy kept snoring through the whole thing. I mean, how could someone sleep through such a stirring film?!?

## Conclusion
Civil War is more than just a film; _**it's an art form** that encourages viewers to reflect on our society_, critiquing our indifference and urging us to examine our own reactions to the world's chaos. It navigates the psychological landscapes of its characters while also serving as a mirror reflecting our own lives.
