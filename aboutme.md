Ookie, lemme tell you about my silly little portfolio by asking this question first: would you consider "the internet" a third space? I feel like it kinda plays that role, especially since we don't have a lot of those here in the US. So, in a way, whenever we're online, we're walking into a new realm, getting teleported into a different place.  If that's the case, our "internet personas" can either be a direct, or close reflection of your physical, human body...or ... I guess you can rebuild your lil online avatar to be someone completely different.

<p><i>"The privelege of a liftime is being who you are"</i> - Joseph Campbell </p>

I would do my time here on Earth a disservice if I acted any different from who I am. Being creative is the ability to express ourselves beyond words, beyond sight, beyond sound... being creative is the ability to express! 

To <i>feel</i> is to be <b>alive</b>. This is me sharing my <i>human-ness</i>! A personal human journey of a silly little girl on Earth around the time of peak patriarchal regime, late stage capitalism, and the modern enlightenment era.

So, my intention for this site is to share my art with the e-world beyond what my physical body can do! Perhaps someone will come across this and feel a sense of connection, and honestly, even if that person is me, that's enough.  I'm not afraid to take up space, or at least, I'm not afraid to anymore.
