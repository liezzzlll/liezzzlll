> Dear reader, before proceeding, I want to be transparent and share that I use an AI tool to help me with this lil' passion project.  My writing is adjusted by an AI tool to help ensure I'm conveying my thoughts clearly and concisely. Rest assured, all content and posts are written solely by me—AI mostly helps with grammar and flow. In the [poetry section](https://liezzzlll.github.io/liezzzlll/poetry/), I work to preserve my unique voice, though I still use an AI tool for rewording ideas. 

Oookie! Now that _**that**_ is out of the way, lemme tell you about my silly little portfolio by asking this question first: would you consider _the internet_ and _the act of being online_ a third space? I feel like it kinda plays that role. So, in a way, whenever we're online, we're walking into a new realm, getting teleported into a different place! If that's the case, our "internet personas" can either be a direct, or close reflection of our physical, human body...**or** ... I guess you can rebuild your lil online persona to be someone completely different, and in some cases, even completely anonymous.

I would do my time here on Earth a disservice if I acted any different from who I truly am inside this virtual, third space, that we spend a lot of time in!

Does that make sense?\
It makes sense to me...

Being creative is the ability to express ourselves beyond words, beyond sight, beyond sound... being creative is the ability to fully express!

As I grow <s>older</s> wiser, I'm learning to embrace this about myself.

To <i>feel</i> is to be <b>alive</b>. This is me sharing my <i>human-ness</i>! A personal human journey of a silly little girl on Earth around the time of peak patriarchal regime, late stage capitalism, and the modern enlightenment era.

So, my intention for this site is to **share my art with the e-world!** _As much art as possible_! I saw this post circulating around on various social media platforms, and I'd like to share it here:
> I think everything in life is art. What you do. How you dress. The way you love someone, and how you talk. Your smile and your personality. What you believe in, and all your dreams. The way you drink your tea. How you decorate your home. Or party. Your grocery list. The food you make. How your writing looks. and the way you feel.\
>**life. is. art.** 

So perhaps someone will come across this page and feel a sense of connection and a glimpse of one slice of my humanity, and honestly, even if that person is me, that's enough. I'm not afraid to take up space, or at least, I'm not afraid to anymore.
